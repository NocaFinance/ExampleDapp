# Vision

We believe, the next billion users shouldn't need to know what chain the dapp is on which they want to interact with and they shouldn't need to bridge funds in order to use them. However, currently, many protocols (RWA/Staking) require the user to bridge their funds. With our hackathon project we want to bring the protocols to the users instead of asking them to come to the protocols. We achieve this by deploying smart contract interfaces for the user on all chains they want to deposit funds on.
Moreover, by batching transactions together, we can reduce gas costs and and bridging costs by 99%. Staking WETH from Polygon into Lido is cheaper than doing it on Ethereum!

# UX

To demonstrate our functionality we build an examplatory UI of a real world asset protocol. Here, we focussed our efforts on user experience as well of course: Depositing from multiple chains is seamless and differently to other real world asset protocols, the user is not required to go to other chains in order to bridge their funds to the correct protocol.
